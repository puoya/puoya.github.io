= Tree Class Documentation =

The `Tree` class provides methods for managing and manipulating phylogenetic trees using the `treeswift` package. This class allows for distance calculation, embedding in geometric spaces, logging, and visualization.

== Usage ==

The `Tree` class can be initialized in two ways:

1. From a file path to load a tree.
2. From an existing `treeswift.Tree` object with a custom name.

Example 1: Initialize from a file path
