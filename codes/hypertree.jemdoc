= Tree Class Documentation
The `Tree` class is designed to handle phylogenetic tree operations using the `treeswift` package and includes additional utilities for embedding trees in Euclidean or hyperbolic geometries. The class supports loading trees from files or directly from `treeswift.Tree` objects. It also provides logging capabilities and various tree-related functionalities such as distance matrix computation, normalization, and embedding.

== Usage Overview

The `Tree` class requires either a file path to load a tree or an already constructed `treeswift.Tree` object as input. It provides methods for tree manipulation, such as computing the treeâ€™s distance matrix, normalizing branch lengths, and embedding the tree in a specified geometry.
