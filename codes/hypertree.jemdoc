= Tree Class Documentation
The {pre}Tree{pre} class is designed to handle phylogenetic tree operations using the {pre}treeswift{pre} package and includes additional utilities for embedding trees in Euclidean or hyperbolic geometries. The class supports loading trees from files or directly from {pre}treeswift.Tree{pre} objects. It also provides logging capabilities and various tree-related functionalities such as distance matrix computation, normalization, and embedding.

== Usage Overview

The {pre}Tree{pre} class requires either a file path to load a tree or an already constructed {pre}treeswift.Tree{pre} object as input. It provides methods for tree manipulation, such as computing the treeâ€™s distance matrix, normalizing branch lengths, and embedding the tree in a specified geometry.
