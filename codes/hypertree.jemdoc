= Tree Class Documentation
The Tree class is designed to handle phylogenetic tree operations using the treeswift package and includes additional utilities for embedding trees in Euclidean or hyperbolic geometries. The class supports loading trees from files or directly from treeswift.Tree objects. It also provides logging capabilities and various tree-related functionalities such as distance matrix computation, normalization, and embedding.
