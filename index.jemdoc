== Research
My current research focus is quantitative finance. Previously, my work covered computational biology, group theory, differential geometry, machine learning, and statistical signal processing. Much of my work is motivated by fundamental questions in modeling, learning, and inference for complex systems.


== Biography 
I earned a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology (2014), an M.S. from Colorado State University (2016), and a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbanaâ€‘Champaign (2021). Since then, I have held postdoctoral positions at UC San Diego through 2025. In September 2025, I will join Capital Fund Management in Paris as a quantitative researcher.
