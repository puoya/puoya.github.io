== Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space
Let us begin with the definition of /Hilbert spaces/.
~~~
{*Definition*}
A Hilbert Space is an /inner product space/ that is /complete/ and /separable/ with respect to the norm defined by the inner product.
~~~

A reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) is a family of functions on some set $\mathcal{X}$ that forms a Hilbert space, with an associated kernel.

To start with, let us definne what we mean by a kernel. We will stick to Euclidean feature spaces $\mathcal{X}$, although everything works out if $\mathcal{X}$ is an arbitrary separable metric space.


\(
\begin{aligned}
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{D} &= \rho_f\\
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} &= 0\\
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} &= -\frac{\partial\mathbf{B}}{\partial t}\\
\nabla \times \mathbf{H} &= \mathbf{J}_f - \frac{\partial\mathbf{D}}{\partial t}.
\end{aligned}
